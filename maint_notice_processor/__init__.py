maint_notice_processor can parse various service provider maintenance
notification emails and extract the affected circuit, time-frame, and
if present, duration of service impact.

This is meant to be extensible with different parser sub-classes for
varying formats of maintenance emails, e.g. a specific class could
help if a vendor used HTML.
